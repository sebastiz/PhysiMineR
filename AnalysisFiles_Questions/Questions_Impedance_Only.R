#Questions_Impedance_Only


# Question:Chance of positive reflux in patients with negative pH impedance but have IOM with any symptoms or classic symptoms. ?Case control


Question areas

Symptom vs Parameter
# Question:What proportion of NERD is related to acid vs non acid.
# What proportion of heartburn has acid (this should be known) ie should I just send all heartburn ppi refractory to Bravo.
# Question:FODMAP and heartburn outcomes for patients with bloating and heartburn overlap

Parameter vs Condition
# Question:Parameters predicting upright and supine and postprandial reflux from impedance.
# Question:Barrett's vs impedance.

#Pathological GERD was defined on MII-pH study by the following criteria:
#Excess total number of reflux episodes (≥48 episodes/24 h on or off PPI);
#abnormal esophageal acid exposure (≥6.3% in upright position and/or ≥1.2% in recumbent position off PPI,
#or ≥1.5% in upright position and/or ≥0.5% on PPI); or positive symptom association (symptom index ≥50%).
