PhysiMineR is a package written in R to help in the extraction, cleaning and analysis of upper GI physiology results. Once completed the package will provide the ability to extract results from a series of file formats and then clean the results so that diagnoses can be automated from the raw numbers. It should also be able to give cross patient analyses.
