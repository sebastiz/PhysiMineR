PhysiMineR is a package written in R to help in the extraction, cleaning and analysis of upper GI physiology results. Once completed the package will provide the ability to extract results from a series of file formats and then clean the results so that diagnoses can be automated from the raw numbers. It should also be able to give cross patient analyses.

The current workflow with associated functions is shown the the diagram below:
